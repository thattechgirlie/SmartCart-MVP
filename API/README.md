A smart trolley API aims to support a supermarket trolley equipped with RFID/barcode sensors to be able to provide real-time billing and faster  checkout. Customers can scan products directly into the trolley, and the total cost will be calculated in real-time thus saving on time and fatigue caused by standing in queues to be checked out
My objectives include:Develop a REST API using Spring Boot.
Learn how to integrate RFID/barcode technology with back-end systems.
Understand how to manage secure transactions.
Work with databases for real-time data updates.
Here's a list of technologies i will use:
Spring Boot
MySQL
PostMan API
IDE to code such as VS code or Intelij IDE
