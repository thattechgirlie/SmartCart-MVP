Inspiration and Technical Challenge
Inspired by personal experiences of frustrating supermarket queues, I set out to develop a solution that enhances checkout efficiency using IoT and machine learning technologies. The main technical challenge was implementing real-time item scanning and processing reliably. I chose to integrate RFID tags for high-frequency accuracy and barcode scanners for non-RFID items. This required meticulous handling of simultaneous scans, error-checking mechanisms, and seamless integration with a Python backend powered by Flask.

Technical Details
Architecture

The system architecture consists of RFID tag readers and barcode scanners integrated into shopping trolleys. Data from these devices is processed by a Flask backend hosted on a Raspberry Pi, ensuring real-time updates and calculations of the total bill.

Algorithms and Technologies
I utilized C++ for low-level interfacing with RFID readers and barcode scanners, leveraging Python for backend processing. TensorFlow was employed for machine learning tasks to optimize scan accuracy over time, enhancing user experience.

Challenges and Solutions
Initially, managing real-time data streams posed latency challenges. I optimized data handling routines and implemented queue-based processing to mitigate delays. Error-checking mechanisms were crucial to ensure accurate scan data processing, enhancing reliability.

Future Iterations
For future iterations, I envision integrating computer vision for automated item recognition, enhancing the system's capability to handle a wider range of products. Implementing a cloud-based architecture could also improve scalability and real-time data processing capabilities.
